# Day-13

Write a program that takes the `price of an item` and `VAT` **(vat is in percentage)** as inputs.  
The program should print the `price of the item` plus `VAT`.  
For Example: If the price is `220` and, VAT is `15%` your code should return a vat inclusive price of `253`.  
If value is a float, round it the closest integer. And the program should print `Invalid Inputs` if program fails.

**Input:** | `386` and `17` | `220` and `15` | `220` and `15` 
**Output:** | `452` | `253` | `235`

## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.
